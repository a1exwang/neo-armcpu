regfile is always written when addr != 0 on posedge, regardless of stall
branch flag and set_stall should be set by combinational logic

stall: the state of whole system should be identical to that where time during
stall set is "removed"

regfile is written by stage_mem at negedge

branch: branch_dest_id2ex: lowest bit indicate whether to jump to this
address(0), or reg2_data(1)
